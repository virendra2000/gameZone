                                   Special Forces Group 2 is a first-person action game that's openly inspired by the legendary Counter-Strike 1.6. It offers a game experience that's very similar to the legendary game from Valve, but from the comfort of an Android device and with a control system that's perfectly adapted to touchscreens.

The controls in Special Forces Group 2 are very user-friendly. The D-pad is located on the left side of the screen, and the buttons to aim, jump, and reload are to the right. To shoot, all you've got to do is put the sight of your scope over the enemy.

In terms of game modes, Special Forces Group 2 really delivers. It's not just that you can play the classic Team Deathmatch either alone (with bots) or online (with other people) “ you can also enjoy the many additional game modes. There's a zombie mode, capture the flag, and much more.

Another strength of Special Forces Group 2 is that it has all the same weapons as the original Counter-Strike“ and way more. And unlike lots of similar games, they're all unlocked from the get-go. Yep, from the very beginning, you can use different kinds of shotguns, sniper rifles, pistols, and machine guns.

Special Forces Group 2 is one of the best FPS games to be found on Android. It may not have the world's best graphics or most original premise (in fact a lot of the settings look basically identical to the ones from Counter-Strike), but it does boast a solid game system that's highly entertaining.

CUSTOMIZE EXTREME RIDES
Pick up the real-world cars you?ve always wanted, from the Subaru BRZ to the BMW M4, McLaren 650s, Porsche 911, and more. Then trick them out with the hottest customization system on mobile, from spots like the Mod Shop and the Black Market, giving you over 2.5 million custom combos to play with. Your rides are waiting ? take them to the stages or streets to go head-to-head versus the competition and prove yourself.

DRIVE FAST ? AND FEARLESS
Steer onto the streets of Blackridge, driving reckless and juiced as sparks fly. Accelerate over jumps and around debris, into traffic, against walls, and through high-speed Nitro Zones. Flip on the nitrous and thrust yourself into another level of adrenaline-fueled driving and drifting. Around every corner is a fresh race as you clash with local crews and local cops. It?s a world full of wannabe drivers ? can you stay in front and earn respect?

RACE TO WIN
Never back down as you race anyone crazy enough to take you on, leave them gapped, and increase your rep. Dig, drift, drag, and roll your ride to wins with police on your tail, hitting each inch of the map hard by the time you reach the big end. Burn rubber in over 1,000 challenging races ? and that?s just the starting line. Be notorious, own the streets, and score the world?s best cars. Because one ride is never enough!

However, you can only move the same number of tiles as the number you roll on a die. As the name suggests, the board is also littered with snakes and ladders.
